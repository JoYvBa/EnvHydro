# EnvHydro
FloPy code for the Griftpark  project of the Environmental Hydrogeology course

To set up everything correctly, put all contents of the repository in a single folder and extract ASCII_matricces.zip to a folder named ASCII_matricces.
Further, when running the scripts, ensure that all file paths are correct, especially the paths to the .exe files of MODFLOW and MT3DMS

This repository consists of:
- `flopy_100x100_v5.py`            --> FloPy Python script that runs the base MODFLOW and MT3DMS models and plots the results. For model specifics, we refer to the report.
- `flopy_100x100_v5_sensitivty.py` --> FloPy Python script that runs the sensitivty analysis for the MODFLOW and MT3DMS model on pumping rate.
- `tools.py`                       --> Seperate Python script containing some helper functions used in the main code
- `ASCII_matricces.zip`            --> Zip file containing .txt files with information of various parameters for transport of Naphthalene and Cyanide. The .txt files are generated by saving the matrix in the data editor of PMWIN. There is a file for each layer and each spatially distributed parameter. It is paramount that the files are in alphabetical order for parameter name and then layer number.

If there are any questions concidering the code, please feel free to contact me!
